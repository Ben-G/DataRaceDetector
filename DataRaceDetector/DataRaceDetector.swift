/// A box around a value that allows for detection of potential data races. 
/// This implementation is based on the ideas of LLVM's Thread Sanitizer and is
/// only intended for educational purposes.
/// 
/// The paper describing Thread Sanitizer can be found here:
/// http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35604.pdf
///
/// Apple also dedicated a part of a 2016 WWDC session to discussing Thread Sanitizer:
/// https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/412/?time=993
/// 
/// # How it works
///
/// All accesses to the boxed value are recorded. For each access this type stores
/// a `MemoryAccessRecord` that keeps track of which thread accessed the value and
/// whether the access was a read or a write operation.
/// Each thread associates a counter with each read and write operation to an
/// `ObservedValue`. For subequent reads and writes these counters are increased.
///
/// The `ObservedValue` itself maintains a data structure that stores these counters
/// for all threads that access the boxed value.
///
/// Whenever a synchronization on an `ObservedValue` occurs, via the `synchronized` function,
/// the current thread gets access to all `MemoryAccessRecord`s and their respective counters stored in
/// `ObservedValue`. This means that the current thread now has access to all the `MemoryAccessRecord`s
/// of all other threads. Later on the `ObservedValue` will use that fact to check for a correct 
/// synchronization.
///
/// When a value is accessed, the access is first recorded, as discussed above. After that
/// the data race detection occurs. 
/// 
/// To detect a data race, we iterate over all memory access records stored in the `ObservedValue`
/// and compare them with the memory access records in thread specific storage.
///
/// A data race is detected when one of the memory access records in
/// the `ObservedValue` does not match the memory access records stored in the current thread - and
/// one of the following conditions is true:
///
/// 1. The current thread is reading and the mismatched memory access record represents a write
/// 2. The current thread is writing and the mismatched memory access record represents a read
/// 3. The current thread is writing and the mismatched memory access record represents a write
///
/// If the memory record in question represents a read and the current thread is reading, we don't
/// have a data race, since a data race is defined as concurrent access by multiple threads of which
/// at least one is writing.
class ObservedValue<T> {

    /// of memory access, but we never validate previous memory accesses to check if they are racing
